## Testing the project

To test the project, run the tester binary in the project root with the following arguments:

```bash
./tester <width> <height> <perfect>
```
- `width`: the width of the maze (in number of cells)
- `height`: the height of the maze (in number of cells)
- `perfect`: write 'perfect'to generate a perfect maze or nothing to make an imperfect

## Graphical version

To access the graphical version of the project, run:

```bash
