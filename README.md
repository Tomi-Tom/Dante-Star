## What is Dante Star

Dante Star is a first year project at Epitech. The goal is to generate a maze and to solve it

Types of mazes generated :
 - Perfect Maze : a maze made of a unique path connecting every cell (or pathway). 
 - Imperfect Maze : a maze made of a path that may intersect itself (non unique path) or/and isolate a group of cells.
